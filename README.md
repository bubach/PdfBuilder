A PDF library for PHP that tries to accomplish these revolutionary goals:

 - Multiple source files - preferably not cramming 35k of lines into one file.
 - Language features & syntax that's actually from _after_ the release of PHP4
 - Some kind of general structure
 - Using hipster shit like temporary streams instead of just passing a few megabyte worth of strings along
 - Possibility to output more then 5 pages without a weeks time & a 50 node cluster

Why? B/C FU, that's why.
