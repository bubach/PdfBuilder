# PdfBuilder
PdfBuilder, a modern PDF generating library for PHP.

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/bubach/PdfBuilder.svg)](https://gitter.im/bubach/PdfBuilder?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bubach/PdfBuilder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bubach/PdfBuilder)

This library aims at being a complete rewrite of FPDF using PSR-2 syntax and PSR-4 autoloading. As such it will mostly contain
the original methods and use the same licensing.  I will try and incooperate some of the most popular FPDF extensions as I go along - feel free to help me out!
